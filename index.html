            <h2 id="mainHeading"> #1 Tahiti</h2>
            <p>
               One of my biggest goals in life is to travel and see the world. When I was younger my parents would take family vacations but we never traveled outside of the states.
                The first of top three places I'd like to visit is Tahiti. The island of Tahiti is absolutely beautiful! I would love to stay in a bungalow over the water and 
                admire the breathtaking scenery. I would love to try snorkeling for the first time and spend time relaxing on the beach.

            <h2>#2 Bali</h2>
            <p>
               In the past year I have realized that I want to have more experiences rather than focus on material things like I have in
               the past. I want to learn more about other cultures and I think Bali would be a great place to do so. It would be life
               changing to see the rice terraces, go hiking, visit the temples and try new food. Bali looks so beautiful and I really
               hope to visit someday!

            <h2>#3 Great Barrier Reef</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               I have always had a fascination with salt water fish. Every time I get the chance, I will always go to an aquarium. The 
               Great Barrier Reef is actually the largest living thing on earth and it can even be seen from space! The Great Barrier
               Reef has over 600 types of hard and soft coral and is home to over 1,500 species of fish! It is also home to 17 different
               species of sea snakes...<b>Yikes!!!</b> I am not a fan of snakes!
